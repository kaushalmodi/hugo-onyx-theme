# Onyx

A documentation theme forked from [Hugo Alabaster
theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-alabaster-theme). It is an
indirect port of [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/).

# Requirements

You need to install the latest version of Go from
https://go.dev/doc/install because this theme component requires
[`hugo mod ..` commands](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/)
to work.

This update on switch to using Hugo Modules was last tested with Hugo
v0.92.0.

# Installing this theme

To use this component,

1.  Add this to your site's TOML config file:

    ```toml
    [module]
      [[module.imports]]
        path = "github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-onyx-theme"
    ```

2.  Run `hugo mod tidy` in your main site directory.

## Theme components

This theme is composed of the base theme "hugo-onyx-theme", and the
"hugo-debugprint" component (which gets auto-fetched using `hugo
mod`).
