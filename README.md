# Onyx

A documentation theme forked from [Hugo Alabaster
theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-alabaster-theme). It is an
indirect port of [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/).

## Quick start

Install with `git`:

```sh
cd /to/your/hugo/site/repo/root
git clone https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-onyx-theme themes/hugo-onyx-theme
```

Next, take a look in the `exampleSite` folder at. This directory contains an
example config file and the content for the demo. It serves as an example setup
for your documentation.

Copy at least the `config.toml` in the root directory of your website. Overwrite
the existing config file if necessary.

Hugo includes a development server, so you can view your changes as you go -
very handy. Spin it up with the following command:

``` sh
hugo server
```

Now you can go to `localhost:1313` and the Onyx theme generated site should be
visible.
